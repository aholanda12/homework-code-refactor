Horiseon Code Refactor

In this project, I took an existing site and remade it with new coding. The largest difference in coding is the unification of elements. Instead of each section having it's own div class with separate header attributes, they have all been combined into as minimal properties as possible. New classes and IDs were only given for sections that deviated from the norm, such as the benefits section.

The code is not 100% 1 to 1 match of the previous website. Some margins and other visual components have been changed due to the unification of properties. However, the overall feel and function of the website remains the same.

This website now follows W3 guidelines and should be accessible to all.
